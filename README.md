### Technical Details

#The overall of the repository is that is consists of the assets folder which contains the images
that the program relies upon for its art style and assets. The Sketch file is where all the code is
to make the clickable maanger to work. The data folder contains the .CSV files that are used to link/store
path/navigation data between files so that images, clickable buttons, etc are all linked. THe index.HTML has the basics to get the website working properly.The "class ScenarioRoom extends PNGRoom {}" is what makes alot of this program tick as that draws the images in webspage based off code from the PNGRoom library. 



#	The speculative tech is set in the future year of 2030.  The story takes place on launch days and this technology is unlike anything else. It has the power to make anyone better off economically and socially, it can take make a homeless person into a business person. Businesses can now become corporations and move up into the millions. It can also take power away from greedy corporations and give power back to the people who can print anything, thus making them have higher quality products with less cost. 

#	This tech also has a great effect on other communities too. It can be utilized by the black market where people can create weapons and enable greater crime and harm across the world. If used by the wrong groups a new war could take place from civil to international with the means to create any tool of destruction in anyone’s hands. Yet the poor now have a chance to become better off as new jobs are created to maintain these machines and they can make their own business too.  The middle class can push into the next layer of wealth and finally progress financially, making room for the lower classes too thus increasing the quality of life.
	
#	I have chosen this aesthetic approach because I am in love with the abstract nature of this type of illustrator art. It provides such minimal colors and vagueness in image clarity that it gives the mind a smooth feeling which only allures me to look at it more. I ask that you see my XD prototype for the 4K ultra high resolution renders as the P5 site was limited to 1280 x 720 it does not fully showcase the art’s mastering.
