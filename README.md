The speculative tech is set in the future year of 2030.  The story takes place on launch days and this technology is unlike anything else. It has the power to make anyone better off economically and socially, it can take make a homeless person into a business person. Businesses can now become corporations and move up into the millions. It can also take power away from greedy corporations and give power back to the people who can print anything, thus making them have higher quality products with less cost. 
	This tech also has a great effect on other communities too. It can be utilized by the black market where people can create weapons and enable greater crime and harm across the world. If used by the wrong groups a new war could take place from civil to international with the means to create any tool of destruction in anyone’s hands. Yet the poor now have a chance to become better off as new jobs are created to maintain these machines and they can make their own business too.  The middle class can push into the next layer of wealth and finally progress financially, making room for the lower classes too thus increasing the quality of life. 
	I have chosen this aesthetic approach because I am in love with the abstract nature of this type of illustrator art. It provides such minimal colors and vagueness in image clarity that it gives the mind a smooth feeling which only allures me to look at it more. I ask that you see my XD prototype for the 4K ultra high resolution renders as the P5 site was limited to 1280 x 720 it does not fully showcase the art’s mastering.
